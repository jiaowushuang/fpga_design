    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         57 out of   9,112    1%
    Number used as logic:                       57 out of   9,112    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              40
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   17
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    17 out of   2,278    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           57
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            22 out of      57   38%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      57    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          35 out of      57   61%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
